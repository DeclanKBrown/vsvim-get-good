## Games

- **HJKL Motions Game:** Learn and practice the fundamental vim motions (`h`, `j`, `k`, `l`) to navigate through text. An `x` appears randomly on the screen, and your task is to delete it using the correct vim motion commands. With each `x` deleted, a new one appears, allowing for continuous practice.

## How to Play

1. Open a blank editor in VSCode.
2. Activate the **HJKL Motions Game** from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac), then type `VSVIM GET GOOD: Start HJKL Game` and press Enter.
3. An `x` will appear in the document. Use the vim motion keys (`h`, `j`, `k`, `l`) to navigate to the `x`.
4. Delete the `x` by pressing `x` in vim command mode.
5. As soon as you delete an `x`, a new one appears at a different location in the document. Continue to delete each new `x` to practice your hjkl motions.
